## Catalogue

### Data harmonisation
Each cohort harmonises the data according to the consortium’s harmonisation protocols into the CDM format which has been centrally agreed on and stores the data locally, not in MOLGENIS catalogue.


### Cohort metadata description
Each cohort decides how each of its variables (original cohort data) is harmonised to the CDM and uploads this information as a source data model into the MOLGENIS catalogue (harmonise the data). For every variable the following syntax needs to be described for harmonisation: attributes, data type, description (harmonised set).

Describe of the model of the cohort (source variables - model of the collected data)

Describe the mapping of the source variables to the harmonised model - network model (consortium wide)

### Cohort harmonisation

### Find harmonisation specifications

### Request access

## Armadillo

### Initial data upload
Upload harmonized data into a local Armadillo/Opal instance in order to make it available for DataSHIELD to run analysis. Note that MOLGENIS catalogue does not communicate or has access to any data stored in Armadillo/Opal.
### Create subsets of the data

### Give permissions on the data

### Quality control

### Request permissions
After the correct authentication and authorization steps have been set up researchers will be able to analyse the cohort’s data via DataSHIELD.
